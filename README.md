# Mars_Data_Challenge

## Overview 

In this project we took on a web-scraping and data analysis assignment for a mission to Mars. This challenge included scraping, organizing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. It was broken into two parts, the first being to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles, and the second part to Scrape and analyze Mars weather data.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file or a MongoDB database.

Here we created a new Jupyter Notebook, and scraped the "Mars News‚Äù through utilizing Splinter and Beautiful Soup. In the code we specifically targeted the title and preview text. The header and text were then stored into a dictionary and then exported to a JSON file. 

### Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

#### How many months exist on Mars?

Based on our findings there are also 12 months on Mars.

#### What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars?

#### Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

#### Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

##Conclusion

In this challenge we learned the power of scraping data and automating this process. We also learned how to visually present this data so that our stakeholders can make informative decisions.
